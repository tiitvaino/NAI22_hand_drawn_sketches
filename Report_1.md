## Group 1: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) evaluation for hand-drawn sketches 

### Members: Karl-Johan Pilve, Aleksandra Rammul, Mart Traagel, Tiit Vaino

### Supervisor: Tarun Khajuria

### Description:
Given hand-drawn sketches of objects, how can one evaluate how well a given sketch represents 
its category class? In this project, the task is to create a Neural Network based model or any 
other algorithm with implementation that can rate the sketch drawings. The drawings showing the 
depicted concept the best shall be rated higher than other rough or incomplete drawings. 


### Motivation:

There are many potential motivations for why we might want to start a project on evaluating 
hand-drawn sketches. One motivation is that by doing so, we can gain a better 
understanding of how the human mind works. When we see someone drawing a picture, we are able to 
understand the meaning of the drawing because our minds are able to interpret the shapes and 
lines in the drawing. However, artificial neural networks are not yet able to do this. By learning how
an artificial neural network interprets hand-drawn sketches, we can maybe draw some insight into how 
partially drawn images are completed in the human mind.

Another motivation for this project is that it could have a number of practical applications. 
For example, if we could develop a neural network that could interpret hand-drawn sketches, 
it could be used to help people with communication disorders, such as those who have difficulty 
speaking or writing. This would be especially beneficial for people who have difficulty communicating 
their thoughts and ideas in words.

Artificial neural networks are interesting to learn about because they can be used to tackle problems that are difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms.
They can be used to create models that are interpretable by humans and can be used to create systems that are adaptive.
### Initial plans:

Replicating a paper on "Finding Badly Drawn Bunnies", https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Yang_Finding_Badly_Drawn_Bunnies_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf
